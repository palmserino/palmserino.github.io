SRC contains all the components/redux/etc for ALL react stuff

Templates contains the index.html

Static will be the compiled js

webpack.config.js really just loads the babel loader 

the dev script in the package.json handles the javascript compilation 
    - the current compilation for main.js goes  intoi the ./dist folder??
